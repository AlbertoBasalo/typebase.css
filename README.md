# Typebase.css
## A starting point for good typography on screens

Typebase.css aims to provide a minimal CSS typography boiler plate. Most css frameworks fail web typography in one of two ways

1. The apply their own aesthetics to typography on the site
2. Don't enforce simple rules

Both force designers & developers to do do extra when building sites. Let Typebase.css handle the vertical rhythm and spacing, you handle the typefaces and design.

It's only [[ put kB in Here ]]
